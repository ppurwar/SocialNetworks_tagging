PCB printout-
1. Around 8 working days after order
2. Initial cost for layout + Around 10 chf per print
3. Assembly is possible - but really costly
4. Take 2-3 prints then test them... before bulk order
5. each component on our own

Next :

1. Potential PCB printouts 
2. follow up



Components:

1. Tag - RFID, MicroController + R/L/C
PCB layout - a. Time taken for printing b. components ordering and soldering ?

2. Reader - buy it. Firmware support 
	# Number of readers
	a. SD card 
	b. Ethernet
3. Server setup


Hardware And Software

Firmware: 

1. Programming of tag
2. Communication with reader (reader firmware)
3. Data collection

Hardware: 

1. Emulator
2. PCB 


Approach : 

1. Parallel work on both sides
2. Get 2 tags and one reader to do firmware side work
3. Emulator to verify working of PCB layout
4. PCB print/ components
