### Hardware Design ###

In this folder you can find our hardware design for the [nRF51822 based OpenBeacon tag](http://get.openbeacon.org). It contains all necessary information for building tags. If you wish, you are free to manufacture the tags yourself.

Alternatively you can choose our services for bulk orders or for custom hardware development based on this and other designs we created in the past. Any kind of support for our project is highly appreciated and allows us to continue working on this great project.
