Final tasks:

Galluszentrum 

1. Visit on friday : 10.40 am (tentative) 
2. Take all readers for range check
3. Make list of equipments (cable, switches). bring tape - Prateek
4. Match - batch id, student id, study id.
5. Size - 80

On site: 
1. measure cable length required
2. add reader details in software code



Kilcheberg

1. Size - 40










Discuss on:
1. Data format for final output
2. LAN support ? or visit to site
3. Battery order 

4. Update on pickit2 





23.03.2016

Program the tags first.

1. Round one vs Square one ....
2. check for feasibility of firmware....


18.03.2016

1. Soldering is bottleneck
2. Order for 5 tags
3. Figure out the details for PCB and components with Alphonso.



02.03.2016

PCB printout-
1. Around 8 working days after order
2. Initial cost for layout + Around 10 chf per print
3. Assembly is possible - but really costly
4. Take 2-3 prints then test them... before bulk order
5. each component on our own


29.02.2016

Next :

1. Potential PCB printouts 
2. follow up



Components:

1. Tag - RFID, MicroController + R/L/C
PCB layout - a. Time taken for printing b. components ordering and soldering ?

2. Reader - buy it. Firmware support 
	# Number of readers
	a. SD card 
	b. Ethernet
3. Server setup


Hardware And Software

Firmware: 

1. Programming of tag
2. Communication with reader (reader firmware)
3. Data collection

Hardware: 

1. Emulator
2. PCB 


Approach : 

1. Parallel work on both sides
2. Get 2 tags and one reader to do firmware side work
3. Emulator to verify working of PCB layout
4. PCB print/ components
